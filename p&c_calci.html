        <h2>Fundamental Principle of Counting</h2>
        <p>It states that <i>“If an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event can occur in n different ways, then the total number of occurrence of the events in the given order is m×n.” </i><br>The above principle can be generalised for any finite number of events.</p>

        <h2>Permutations</h2>
        <p>Definition : A permutation is an arrangement in a definite order of a number of objects taken some or all at a time.</p>

          <legend>Permutation when all the objects are distinct</legend>
          <p>Theorem 1  The number of permutations of n different objects taken r at a time, where 0 < r ≤ n  and the objects do not repeat  is n ( n – 1) ( n – 2). . .( n – r + 1), which is denoted by nPr.
          </p>
          <p>
            Factorial notation  The notation n! represents the product of first n natural numbers, i.e., the product 1 × 2 × 3 × . . . × (n – 1) × n is denoted as n!. We read this symbol as ‘n factorial’. Thus, 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 . . .  × (n – 1) × n = n ! 1 = 1 ! 1 × 2 = 2 !1× 2 × 3 = 3 ! 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 4 ! and so on.
            We define 0 ! = 1 Clearly, for a natural number n     n ! = n (n  –  1) ! = n (n  –  1) (n  –  2) ! [provided (n ≥ 2)] = n (n  –  1) (n  –  2)  (n  –  3) ! [provided (n ≥ 3)] and so on.

          <p>Theorem 3 The number of permutations of n objects, where p objects are of the
          same kind and rest are all different = 
          ! ! n p
          .
          In fact, we have a more general theorem.</p> 
          <p>
            Theorem 4 The number of permutations of n objects, where p1 objects are of one kind, p2 are of second kind, ..., pk are of kth kind and the rest, if any, are of different kind is n!/(p1!p2!...pk!)

        <h2>Combinations</h2>
        <p>
          In mathematics, a combination is a selection of items from a collection, such that (unlike permutations) the order of selection does not matter. For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. More formally, a k-combination of a set S is a subset of k distinct elements of S.
        </p>
        <p>Formula:</p>
        <p>
          Combinations refer to the combination of n things taken k at a time without repetition. To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms k-selection,[1] k-multiset,[2] or k-combination with repetition are often used.[3] If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears.
